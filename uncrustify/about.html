<h1>About the Uncrustify Documentation Project</h1>
<p>
This <a href="index.html"><b>U</b>ncrustify <b>D</b>ocumentation <b>P</b>roject</a> is <b>not</b> the official <a href="https://github.com/uncrustify/" target="_blank">uncrustify</a> documentation.</br>
In fact uncrustify doesn't provide a <i>real</i> documentation.
</p>
<pre>
> uncrustify --help
  Usage:
  uncrustify [options] [files ...]
  ...
  There are currently 850 options and <b>minimal documentation</b>.
  Try UniversalIndentGUI and good luck.
</pre>
(Code <a href="https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify/blob/master/src/uncrustify.cpp#L243">here</a>)

<p>Because uncrustify users are developers, uncrustify source code is too often used as the official documentation.<br/>
The best you can get (outside the code) is this <a href="https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify/tree/master/documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a> 
directory. The <a href="https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a> is only about the internal design of uncrustify.
</p>
<p>The <b>U</b>ncrustify <b>D</b>ocumentation <b>P</b>roject is an independant effort to make more obvious the effect of each of the ~850 options.</p>
